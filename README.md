# Bequeth-Smart-Contract

Summary:
    A smart contract made on the Ethereum blockchain using solidity ^0.6.10.
    It's a contract that lets your kin or anyone of your choice take your funds after your time in this world.

Full-on explanation:
    You convert your assets into ether and put it in the smart contract.
    You check-in every year to tell the smart contract that you're still alive and to extend the validity by (say) one more year or any time period. 
    When you fail to check-in ,the smart contract lets your kin/anyone to tranfer your funds into their account.
    Only the owner can check-in and extend the time by a year. But the funds can be transferred by that kin/anyone.
    Since this will be on the blockchain, so, it will be peer-to-peer and anybody can view it and verify its authenticity.
